# MinePanel 
This will be a pretty simple-to-use interface for managing a Minecraft server. It gives you the ability to edit properties and such without ever having to touch the properties file, and if you want to change one of the more advanced properties, you can do that too. You can add custom commands, too! For more info about that, see the wiki.

All the user has to do is forward a port and then the app will do the rest! The only file the user has to manually edit is the EULA file created on startup for the first time, since if Minepanel edited it for them, they wouldn't have consciously agreed to the EULA.

## Setup/Instructions:
If you want to learn how to install and use Minepanel, check [the wiki](https://github.com/WillEccles/MinePanel/wiki)! It will guide you through the process of setting up Minepanel and all the things you can do with it.

## To-do:
1. ~~Get it running the jar and showing the output. This is the current goal.~~
2. ~~Make sure file IO exceptions are all handled nicely. Don't want the program crashing because the user messed with it, now do we?~~
3. Make it look nicer. I'm using SWT (with WindowBuilder) to make the GUI. While it does use native designs, images, etc., I'm not a GUI designer. I'm a programmer. Any help with the locations of buttons would be much appreciated.

## Setting up your own project:
[See the wiki for instructions on how to set up your Minepanel project in Eclipse.](https://github.com/WillEccles/MinePanel/wiki/Contribution)

## So when will it be done?
Since I am a student, I have limited time to work on this project, and it has been dormant for a long time now. I recently looked back into it, and it's pretty close to being where I want it for release. It really should work for most people at this time, but I don't yet have executables created for release since it's a good amount of work (easiest way for me just is to create one on each OS that I want to release it for).

## How much will it cost?
Well, it'll be free. However, you can always buy the DLC to allow the app to run a server :trollface:

But seriously, it will be totally free. If you like the project, you should [donate here.](https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=donate&chid=100-000) If you donate, prove it to me and I will add your name here ;)
